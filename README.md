# From Cold Snaps to Heat Waves: Decoding NYC’s Electricity Demand (2010–2022)

**A comprehensive data exploration analyzing how weather extremes shape New York City’s electricity consumption and cost.**

## 📖 Project Description

Between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2022, New York City experienced increasingly volatile temperature patterns—from brutal cold snaps in winter to record-breaking heat waves in summer. This Jupyter notebook:

1. **Frames clear research questions** around how daily average temperature, heating degree days (HDD), and cooling degree days (CDD) relate to city-wide electricity demand (MWh) and cost (USD).
2. **Integrates two public datasets**: Central Park’s historical weather records (Kaggle) and NYC OpenData’s electricity consumption & cost.
3. **Walks through complete data preparation**: cleaning, aligning dates, handling missing values, and merging time series.
4. **Showcases exploratory visualizations**—interactive line charts and heatmaps—to reveal seasonality, trends, and anomalies.
5. **Conducts rigorous statistical analysis**: Pearson & Spearman correlations, hypothesis tests, and rolling-window trend assessments.
6. **Summarizes actionable insights** for grid operators and policymakers, highlighting how air-conditioning loads drive summer peaks and why electric heating plays a smaller role in winter usage.
